# Ecommerce-shipping-data-visualization

The database contains 1.8 Million Sales Orders spread over 15 years. It is an eCommerce database that has data from End Consumers who have placed orders on multiple retail websites. When placing an order, a customer can select a shipping method based on their urgency and cost preferences. This database contains lots of different shipping methods (1000+) because each retail site may have their own set-up and rules with regards to Shipping. Hence, the shipping methods has to be normalized across 1.8 Million Sales Orders into a smaller list of just 6 standardized methods based on service type such as Next Day, 2 Day, 3 Day, Ground, Ground Home Delivery, Ground Saver. Using judgment and best-practices data was quickly but intelligently transformed each of these 1000+ shipping methods to one of these 6 standardized service types.
